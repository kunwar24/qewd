- Make sure that Node.js is installed (v12.x or v14.x)

- Create a directory for each MicroService, eg:

    c:\qewd-orchestrator
    c:\qewd-login-service

- Copy the files for each micro-service to these folders

- Start 2 console processes/windows, one for each of the microservices, and cd to the appropriate folder, eg:

    cd \qewd-orchestrator

- One-off step for each: install the Node.js modules

    npm install


- Once install is complete, you can start the microservice:

    npm start {{microservice name}}

eg

    npm start orchestrator

or

    npm start login_service


- The orchestrator should automatically find and connect to/register the microservice(s) when they start.

- YOu can now try the REST APIs
